      dotsync is installed. To set up multi-machine continuity:

        # First machine
        dotsync init
        dotsync pair

        # Second machine
        dotsync join --code <code from pair>

        # Back on first machine
        dotsync add-peer <id from join's output>

    # Smoke checks: --help and --version exit 0 without touching anything.
